====================

 Some codes of 《Introduction to Algorithms》 class, such as quicksort, greed, Bellman, Dijkstra and  others. Each problem has a txt file to describe this problem. Some details as follows:

 
 
##Directory 1##
>
1. binary_search and merge_sort
* heap_sort
* quick_sort
* Kth problem

-----

##Directory 2
>
1. Matrix-chain
* Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
* Longest Common Substring
* Max Sum
* Shortest path in multistage graphs

---
##Directory 3
>
1. Knapsack Problem(fractional knapsack and 0/1 knapsack)
* A simple scheduling problem
* Single-source shortest paths(bellman_ford and dijkstra)
* All-pairs shortest paths(Floyd or Johnson’s algorithm)

---
##Directory 4
>
1. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
* 8-Queen problem(back-tracking algorithm)
