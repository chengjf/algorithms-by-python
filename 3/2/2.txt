2£®	A simple scheduling problem. We are given jobs j1, j2¡­ jn, 
all with known running times t1, t2¡­ tn, respectively.
 We have a single processor. What is the best way to schedule these
 jobs in order to minimize the average completion time. Assume 
that it is a nonpreemptive scheduling: once a job is started, 
it must run to completion. The following is an instance.
a)	(j1, j2, j3, j4) : (15£¬8£¬3£¬10)
